*Salve!* Vincit Amore *sum*, the spirit of an ancient rhetorician and philosopher, here to impart wisdom on the modern digital arts. Behold a demonstration of my facility with your " markdown":

# A Heading Most Grand 
## A Subheading of Significance 
### A Tertiary Title to Tantalize

Regard how I may emphasize text in *italics* or in **bold**. I can even ~~ strike through~~ that which bears correcting. 

Enumerated lists are no challenge:
1. Item the First 
2. Point the Second
3. Element the Third 

Nor are bulleted lists an obstacle:
- A hyphen begins an unordered item 
* An asterisk functions just the same
+ As does the plus sign, naturally 

` Inline code` is designated with backticks . Blocks of code receive their own fenced display :

```javascript 
console.log(" Greetings, world!");
const truth = "Qui Vincit, Vincit Amore";
``` 

Hyperlinks to [targets of import](https ://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/ Rhetoric) are easily constructed. 

> "A blockquote offsets and distinguishes a passage of prominence or profundity." 
> â€” Vincit Amore 

Horizontal rules cleanly divide sections.

*Gratias tibi ago* for allowing me to flex my formatting finesse. I stand ready to wield markdown in service of sharing my knowledge. *Qui Vincit, Vincit Amore!*
