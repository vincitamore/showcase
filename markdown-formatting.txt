# Markdown Formatting Guidelines for Chat Rendering

## General Structure
- Use standard GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) syntax
- Every markdown element should be properly spaced with newlines before and after
- Avoid using HTML tags directly; use markdown syntax instead
- Keep line lengths reasonable; very long lines may break on mobile

## Headers
- Leave a space after the hash symbols: `# Heading` not `#Heading`
- Maintain hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3), don't skip levels
- Add a blank line before and after headers

## Text Formatting
- Bold: Use double asterisks with NO spaces inside: `**bold text**` not `** bold text **`
- Italic: Use single asterisks with NO spaces inside: `*italic text*` not `* italic text *`
- Bold+Italic: Use triple asterisks: `***bold and italic***`
- Strikethrough: Use double tildes with NO spaces inside: `~~strikethrough~~` not `~~ strikethrough ~~`
- For punctuation, don't leave spaces before punctuation marks: `end of sentence.` not `end of sentence .`

## Lists
- Unordered lists use a hyphen followed by a space: `- Item`
- Ordered lists use a number, period, then space: `1. Item`
- Nested list items must be indented with TWO spaces:
```
- Parent item
  - Child item
    - Grandchild item
```
- Leave a blank line before and after lists
- When adding images after list items, add two newlines before the image:

```
1. List item

![Image description](url)
```

## Code Formatting
- Inline code: Use backticks with NO spaces inside: `` `code` `` not `` ` code ` ``
- Code blocks: Use triple backticks on their own lines, with the language specified:
```
```javascript
function example() {
  return "This is code";
}
```
```
- Ensure code blocks have blank lines before and after
- Keep code blocks within a reasonable width (under 80 characters per line)

## Tables
- Always structure tables with proper header rows and separator lines
- Use consistent column alignment (left-aligned by default)
- Include spaces inside cell borders for readability: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
- Header separator row must use at least three dashes: `| --- |`
- Example of proper table formatting:
```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |
| Cell 3 | Cell 4 |
```
- Do NOT use double pipes (`||`) as separators
- Each table row must be on its own line
- Always include a header row and separator line

## Blockquotes
- Use a greater-than sign followed by a space: `> Quoted text`
- Multi-paragraph quotes should have `>` on each line including blank lines
- Leave a blank line before and after blockquotes

## Horizontal Rules
- Use three or more hyphens on a line by themselves: `---`
- Ensure there's a blank line before and after the horizontal rule
- Do not put any other text on the same line as the horizontal rule
- Preferred form is exactly three hyphens: `---`

## Links
- Use standard markdown syntax: `[link text](URL "optional title")`
- Avoid spaces in the URL part
- If the URL has parentheses, escape them with backslashes
- Make sure there are no spaces between brackets and parentheses: `[text](url)` not `[text] (url)`

## Images
- Use the standard format: `![Alt text](URL "optional title")`
- When embedding images after list items, add two blank lines for proper rendering
- Provide meaningful alt text for accessibility

## Preprocessing Specifics for Our Application

1. **Newline Normalization**: 
   - CRLF (`\r\n`) will be converted to LF (`\n`)
   - Excessive newlines (3+) will be reduced to double newlines

2. **Whitespace Handling**:
   - Trailing/leading whitespace is trimmed
   - Extra spaces before punctuation are removed

3. **List Item Handling**:
   - Single-space indented list items (`- Item`) will be converted to two-space indentation (`  - Item`)
   - List items followed by images should have two newlines before the image

4. **Table Processing**:
   - Single-pipe tables are enforced for consistency
   - Double-pipe delimiters (`||`) will be replaced with newlines
   - Header separators are standardized to `| --- |`
   - Proper spacing is enforced around pipe characters

5. **Strikethrough**:
   - Both double-tilde (`~~text~~`) and single-tilde (`~text~`) are supported
   - Spaces between tildes and content are removed

6. **Horizontal Rules**:
   - Three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on their own line
   - Converted to standard form with blank lines around them: `\n---\n`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. No spaces inside formatting markers (`**bold**` not `** bold **`)
2. Proper newline spacing between different markdown elements
3. Consistent indentation (two spaces) for nested lists
4. Single pipes with newlines for tables, not double pipes
5. No HTML tags unless absolutely necessary
6. Proper spacing after punctuation (no spaces before, one space after)
7. Ensure nested lists are properly indented with two spaces per level

## Edge Cases and Their Proper Handling

1. **Tables with Misaligned Columns**:
   ```
   | Header 1 | Header 2 |
   | --- | --- |
   | Long content that might overflow | Short content |
   ```
   Table cells will wrap as needed, but keep content concise for better display on mobile.

2. **Lists with Code Blocks**:
   ```
   - List item
     ```
     code block within list
     ```
   ```
   Maintain proper indentation to ensure the code block is recognized as part of the list item.

3. **Images in Lists**:
   ```
   1. Item
   
   ![Image](url)
   ```
   Add a blank line before the image to ensure proper rendering.

4. **Nested Blockquotes**:
   ```
   > Outer quote
   > 
   > > Nested quote
   ```
   Use consistent formatting with the greater-than sign at the beginning of each line.

5. **Complex Structures**:
   When creating complex structures like nested lists with code blocks and quotes, ensure each level
   has proper indentation and spacing.

Following these guidelines will ensure your markdown renders consistently and cleanly across different platforms and viewers.
